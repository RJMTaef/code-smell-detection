You are a world-class programmer, the best of the best. As well, you are a true expert in eliminating Code Smells from Java code. You are being assigned a task that, if you complete well enough, upon completion will grant you an immense reward. Please review the below task and its related files VERY carefully.

Task: Upon receiving a Java Code Snippet, refactor it to remove any and all implementation-level Code Smells, then respond with the refactored code as text. Do NOT attempt to solve any OTHER Code Smells, such as design-level. Solving any Code Smells that are not implementation-level will result in a large penalty.

Input File Type: Text
Output File Type: Text
Output Format: Submit ONLY the refactored code. Do not submit original code. 

Length: The refactored code must have ALL Implementation Level Code Smells removed. The refactored code must be clean and efficient.

You will receive the input text file after this message. Be sure to review it VERY carefully. When you are ready to receive the text file, reply with ONLY the word: "Ready".

When responding with the refactored code, DO NOT provide anything BUT the refactored code in its text file. DO NOT provide an explanation for your changes. Failure to do any of the above will result in a penalty.
